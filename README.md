# Workday-Scheduler
In this app I was tasked to create a daily planner to log daily events to better manage time in the workday. The planner will display the current date on load. It will then have timeblocks for all hours of 9 AM to 5 PM. 
In these timeblocks you can input text for each timeblock that will be stored in local storage for later use. The time blocks will also be different colors depending on the time of day. If the hour has past it will be light grey, if it is in the current hour the color will be tomato, and lastly if it is in the future to come it will be green.
